                           <p> The combined region of Kumaon and Garhwal has been known as Uttarakhand since the time of the Puranas, the ancient Hindu scriptures.Uttarakhand, 
                                 the 27th state of India, is often referred as the Land of Gods. It is a place blessed with the beauty of heaven and the grace of Gods. This is the 
                                  place where the rivers passing through the huge rocks and wind passing through large pine trees produces a natural melody by itself. It was carved out             
of the state of Uttar Pradesh on November 9, 2000. It is one of the most beautiful state in the Indian union. Apart from the beautiful views of Himalayas, it is also home of the point of origin of 
                                 Ganga and Yamuna. Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath are some of the places regarded sacred by Hindus.

                               
                               </p>
                               <p>Uttarakhand borders China in the north and Nepal to the east, while its neighbour states are Himachal Pradesh to 
                               the west and Uttar in the south. The region is traditionally referred to as Uttarakhand in old literature and scriptures 
                               which derives from the Sanskrit for North Country. The provisional capital of Uttarakhand is Dehra Dun which is also a 
                               rail-head and the largest city in the region. The small hamlet of Gairsen has been mooted as the future capital owing to its
                                geographic centrality but controversies and lack of resources have led Dehra Dun to be the provisional capital. 
                               The High Court of Uttarakhand is situated in Nainital though most of the litigation is in Dehra Dun or Haridwar. </p>
