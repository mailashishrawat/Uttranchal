panoramic view of the Himalayas.

In 1929, Mahatma Gandhi stayed here for 14 days at the Anasakti Ashram while scripting his book titled 'Anasakti Yoga' and was greatly impressed by its environs.The town is accessible all year round. For those who wish to avoid the cold, the best season is between April to June and again between September to November.
