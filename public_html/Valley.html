   <h2>Valley Of Flower</h2>
<p>A sprawling expanse of 87 square kilometers in the Chamoli District of Uttarakhand, Valley of Flowers is set in the backdrop of the majestic Zanskar Ranges. This virtual paradise on earth has been unknown to the outside world till the great Mountaineer Frank S Smith discovered it in the year 1931.

A world heritage site, the valley is situated at a very remarkable area, which is the conversion point of Himalayan ranges, Zanskar and Western and Eastern Himalayas. This fairyland located in the high altitudes of Himalayas is protected by snowy mountains. Bounded by the magnificent mountain ranges and glittering glaciers, this place unfolds the charisma and charm of nature at its best.

Unspoiled by human invasions this imposing land lay iced up in the colder months, and burst into its majestic boom on the arrival of hotter months. During these months the valley sheds its somnolent nature with its multitudes of exotic flora. When the monsoon clouds began to drizzle, the valley shows its flowery face and the entire region would glisten like a colourful carpet.

A scenic place where the nature blooms with its entire vista can be accessible by a 
tedious but lovely stroll. Eye catching spectacles like the cascading waterfalls, 
small streams and above all the flowery meadows awaits the visitors all through the way. 
With the flamboyant paddocks, crystalline streams and majestic peaks, 
this baroque of flowers is a worthy watch spectacle.
