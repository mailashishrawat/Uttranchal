<h2>Mussoorie </h2>


<p>Mussoorie, Queen of the Hills, located some 290 km north of New Delhi, is among the most 
popular hill stations of the country. It is a captivating paradise for leisure travellers 
and honeymooners. A perfect summer resort and a major educational and cultural centre has
 been rolled into one hub. Located on a 15 km long horseshoe ridge with the grand Himalayas 
 as a backdrop, the colonial hill resort of Mussoorie spreads across at a height of 2,005.5 
 m above sea level. 
From this vantage point, Mussoorie offers superb scenic view of peaks of the Himalayas in 
western Garhwal. Mussoorie boasts of some of the most spectacular views of the Himalayas. 
Hill ridges, irregular in shape and partly wooded, form layer after layer to the horizon, 
where snow capped mountain peaks are visible as though you can touch them. From West to 
East, the mighty peaks of Bandar Poonch, Srikantha, the Gangotri group and the Chaukhamba 
present a mesmerizing panorama. 34 km from Dehradun, Mussoorie overlooks the majestic Doon 
valley to its south and the impressive Himalayas up north. The mountains beckon climbers, 
trekkers and adventure sport enthusiasts. Trekkers begin their journey into the popular 
trekking area of Hari-ki-Doon with its snowscapes and verdant-forested slopes from Mussoorie. The holy River Ganga is visible from one end of the ridge and Yamuna from the other, a stretch of around 20 km in all, from Cloud's end in the west to Jabarkhet in the east.
One of the most easily accessible hill stations in Northern India, during the peak tourist
 season, Mussoorie becomes a bustling resort with hordes of holiday-makers ambling down the 
 central Mall. The suburban area of Landour, about 300 m away from the main town,
  is quieter and has managed to retain some of its old colonial charm. Surrounded by 
  lush wooded expanses and winding lanes, it offers exclusive opportunities for quiet walks.
   It overlooks the sprawling Doon valley and the city of Dehradun, the gateway to 
   Mussoorie and to entire Garhwal.
