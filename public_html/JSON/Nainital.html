<h2>Nainital </h2>
<p>The beautiful lake resort nestles amidst seven hills in a lush valley at an altitude of 1938 meters. In 1841, the British first discovered Nainital as a holiday resort. Today, the town has emerged as one of the most important hill resorts of India
 
Nainital is a modem hill resort of northern India (336 kms from Delhi) connected  by best-aligned and maintained roads from the railhead of Kathgodam. Railway line was laid up to Kathgodam in 1882. The road passes through forests where occasionally wild animals can also be seen. "Naini" is derived from the temple of goddess Naini which was built on the bank of the lake but later got destroyed due to land slides in the year 1880, The place is mentioned in Skand Puran as 'Trishul Sarover'. Tri Rishi (three sages Atri, Pulastiya and Pulha) had come there for pilgrimage while they were at Gagar range (now called China Peak), they felt thirsty and could not find any water. Thereafter, they thought of Man Sarover and dug a hole which at once got filled with water.
 
	

 
The lake then formed was called Tri-Rishi Tal (The lake of three sages). Today it has an impressive lake surrounded by the hills from three sides with highest peak Cheena (2610 m) and the valley in between running from east to west. The lake is a little more than 3 kms in circumference.
Nainital remains packed from April to November with tourist for sight seeing as well as for seeking escape from the heat of the plains. Naini lake has facilities for boating and yatching. Facilities for horse riding, skating, golf and rock climbing are also available for the visitors. Fishing is also permitted with the permission of local authorities. Talli Tal and Malli Tal are the two main trading centre at Nainital
